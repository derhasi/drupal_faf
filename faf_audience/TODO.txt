GENERAL
=======
* Looking for other concepts (especially regarding Drupal 7) dealing with "audience" and privacy.
* Look on the performance site of this module.

BUGPREVENTION
=============
* Multistep on preset creation if type has selector options (or extra config).

FEATURES
========
* Grouping of audience sets into one set
* Concept for audience permissions, that can be used by other modules like faf.module itself.
* Provide additional export load and save handling, so configurations for serialized
  options like user-uid can be exported in an "exportable" way.
  Maybe using exportable.module for that.
